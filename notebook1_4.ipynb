      "Great choice! Indian cuisine is known for its bold flavors and aromatic spices. Let's start with a classic and popular dish - Chicken Tikka Masala. Here's a simple recipe for you to try at home:\n",
      "\n",
      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces\n",
      "- 1 cup plain yogurt\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons lemon juice\n",
      "- 2 teaspoons ground cumin\n",
      "- 2 teaspoons paprika\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon garam masala\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon ground coriander\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon chili powder (adjust to taste)\n",
      "- 3 cloves garlic, minced\n",
      "- 1-inch piece of ginger, grated\n",
      "- Salt and pepper to taste\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons oil\n",
      "- 1 onion, finely chopped\n",
      "- 1 can (14 oz) tomato sauce\n",
      "- 1 cup heavy cream\n",
      "- Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)\n",
      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. In a bowl, mix together the yogurt, lemon juice, cumin, paprika, turmeric, garam masala, coriander, chili powder, garlic, ginger, salt, and pepper. Add the chicken pieces and coat them well with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight for best results.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened and translucent.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Add the marinated chicken pieces to the skillet, along with any remaining marinade. Cook for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is browned on all sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Pour in the tomato sauce and bring to a simmer. Cook for another 10-15 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Stir in the heavy cream and simmer for an additional 5 minutes. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Garnish with chopped cilantro before serving. Serve hot with steamed rice or naan bread.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjoy your homemade Chicken Tikka Masala! Feel free to adjust the spice levels to suit your taste preferences.For a vegetarian version of Chicken Tikka Masala, you can substitute the chicken with a plant-based alternative such as tofu or paneer. Here's how you can prepare the tofu or paneer to use in this recipe:\n",
      "\n",
      "Tofu:\n",
      "1. Use extra-firm tofu and press it to remove excess water. You can do this by wrapping the tofu block in a clean kitchen towel and placing a heavy object on top for about 15-30 minutes.\n",
      "2. Cut the tofu into bite-sized cubes and follow the marinade instructions in the recipe. Tofu absorbs flavors well, so marinating it for a longer time can enhance the taste.\n",

      "Paneer:\n",
      "1. If you prefer paneer, you can either make it at home or buy it from the store. Cut the paneer into cubes and follow the marinade instructions in the recipe.\n",
      "2. Paneer is delicate, so marinate it for a shorter time compared to tofu to prevent it from breaking apart.\n",
